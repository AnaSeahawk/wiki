Sorcery

The tragedy of today's man is not his social condition, but the lack of will to change himself. 

It is very easy to design collective revolutions, but to genuinely change, to put an end to selfpity, to erase the ego, to abandon our habits and whims... ah, that's something else entirely! 

Sorcerers say that true rebellion, and humanity's only way out as a species, is to stage a revolution against their own stupidity. As you can understand, this is solitary work. 

The goal of sorcerers is this sorcerers' revolution: The unrestricted unfolding of all our perceptual possibilities. 

I have never known a greater revolutionary than my teacher. He didn't just suggest changing tortillas for bread; oh no, he went straight to the core of the matter. He proposed a deadly somersault of thought to the unknown, the release from all ties. And he demonstrated that it is possible! 

"He suggested that I fill my life with decisions of power, with strategies which, will bring me to awareness. He taught me that the order of the world doesn't have to be as we've been told; that I can toss it aside anytime. I am not obliged to uphold an image before others, or live in an inventory that doesn't suit me. My battle field is the path of the warrior!"
