# Collaborative groups

**How Collaborative Groups are Different** 

Collaborative is the term I’ve chosen to describe groups that are based on shared power and the inherent worth and value of each member. Brafman and Beckstrom, in The Starfish and the Spider, characterize what they call starfish groups as very amorphous and fluid. Because power and knowledge are distributed, individual units quickly respond to a multitude of internal and external forces — they are constantly spreading, growing, shrinking, mutating, dying off and reemerging. This quality makes them very flexible.2 How do I define a collaborative group? It’s a group that has most if not all of the following characteristics:

• Structured as circles, webs or networks, not pyramids or trees 

• Groups of peers, with a horizontal structure, working together to create something and to make decisions 

• Groups without formal authority, no bosses that can hire or fire you. (In some hybrid groups, that authority might exist but be rarely and reluctantly imposed.) 

• Businesses that run collectively or cooperatively 

• Groups where the major reward may not be money, but something else — creative fulfillment, impact on the world, spiritual development, personal growth, or friendship

• Often formed around strong, altruistic values — from saving the world to sharing knowledge to religious observation or community celebration 

• Groups of humans — which means that motives of gain, status and power do come into play, if not overtly, then covertly 

• Groups that often have few or no overt rules, but many norms 

• Often ephemeral, for better or worse
