# Mother Spirit

EMPOWERED COMPANIONSHIP

Blessing the World with the Mother Spirit

A Call to All Women, too Pass This Forward. 

Sharing this world community event as an invitation to gather in the Spirit of The Mother; to lay down our armor, and to be seen and felt in safe and sacred space. Offering the circle as an activation to raise the collective consciousness of what it means to be in communion with ourselves, and the world around us, through the experience of the female body. 

Unity in Communion.

We believe that this is a time for women to come together in our power, to disrupt the energy that is driving further separation in our world. If you are living in Luang Prabang and looking to connect to other women deeply and authentically; if you are a traveller looking for a circle that feels like home, join us for an evening of inspiring discussion, sharing, and energetic practices such as sound activations and breathing. 

During our circle, Ineke will be offering an introduction to the female hormones, the key messengers of health and wellbeing. We will identify these hormones and gain an understanding of how to listen to the subtle messages that are carried within them. Tuning into the soft voices that speak from within the depths of our bodies means that we can be empowered to make the right lifestyle decisions. This is an opportunity for anyone struggling with hormonal fluctuations, changes or chronic imbalances to find out more about how to reclaim the power of your health. 

As part of the circle, Julie will also lead voice activations that will connect your outer voice to your inner voice as a way of self-regulating. These are powerful tools that tap into emotions as a way to connect to the nervous system, the immune system and the endocrine (hormone) system on an energetic level.
