# Mother Spirit

EMPOWERED COMPANIONSHIP

Blessing the World with the Mother Spirit

A Call to All Women, too Pass This Forward. 

Sharing this World Community event as an invitation to gather in the Spirit of The Mother; to lay down our armor, and to be seen and felt in safe and sacred space. Offering the circle as an activation to raise the collective consciousness of what it means to be in communion with ourselves, and the world around us, through the experience of the female body.

Unity in Communion.

The shared experience of communion transcends differences, emphasizing the common bond that unites all.

It is time for women to come together in our power, to disrupt the energy that is driving further separation in our world. No matter where you are living connect to other women deeply and authentically; a circle that feels like home, inspiring discussion, sharing, and energetic practices such as sound activations and breathing. 

Tuning into the soft voices that speak from within the depths of our bodies means that we can be empowered to make the right lifestyle decisions.
